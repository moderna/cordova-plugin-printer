## Using the plugin
The plugin creates the object ```window.plugin.printer``` with two methods:

### isServiceAvailable()
Printing is only available on devices capable of multi-tasking (iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4 etc.) running iOS 4.2 or later. You can use this function to hide print functionality from users who will be unable to use it.<br>
Function takes a callback function, passed to which is a boolean property. Optionally you can assign the scope in which the callback will be executed as a second parameter (default to *window*).

```javascript
/*
 * Find out if printing is available. Use this for showing/hiding print buttons.
 */
window.plugin.printer.isServiceAvailable(
    function (isAvailable) {
        alert(isAvailable ? 'Service is available' : 'Service NOT available');
    }
);
```

### print()
Function takes an html string.

**Note:** All required CSS rules needs to be included as well.

```javascript
// Get HTML string
var page = document.body.innerHTML;

// Pass the HTML
window.plugin.printer.print(page);
```


## Quirks

### Testing in the iOS Simulator
There's no need to waste lots of paper when testing - if you're using the iOS simulator, select File->Open Printer Simulator to open some dummy printers (print outs will appear as PDF files).

### Adding Page Breaks to Printouts
Use the 'page-break-before' property to specify a page break, e.g.

```html
<p>
First page.
</p>

<p style="page-break-before: always">
Second page.
</p>
```

See W3Schools for more more information: http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_print_pagebb.asp

Note: you will need to add an extra top margin to new pages.
